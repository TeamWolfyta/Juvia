## ‚ùì Why is the repo named Juvia?

When choosing the name I wanted it to be anime related while also keeping a connection to docker, I picked Juvia because she is a character from one of my favorite animes [Fairy Tale](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35972/Fairy_Tail__Final_Series) and she is a very powerful Water magic user, Docker's logo is a whale and whales need water :)
