## ❓ Why is the repo named Juvia?

I wanted the name of my docker stack to be personal but still have some connection to docker. With my extreme love of Anime, I wanted to use the name of a character from one of my favorite Anime and for the connection to docker, that would be water because docker's logo is a whale, So I searched for an anime character that was somehow related to water after a long time searching I came across Juvia Lockser from Fairy Tail who specializes with water. So that's why the repo is named Juvia. Boom 💥
