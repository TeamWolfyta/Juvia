## ❓ Why is the repo named Juvia?

When choosing the name I wanted it to be Anime related while also keeping a connection to Docker, I picked the name Juvia because she is a character from one of my favorite Animes [Fairy Tail](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35972/Fairy_Tail__Final_Series) and she is a very powerful water magic user, Docker's logo is a whale and whales need water so you can see the connection! 😁
